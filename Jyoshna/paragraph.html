  <h1><u>The Cunning Fox and Clever Stork</u></h1>

  <p>
    One day, a <b>selfish fox</b> invited a stork for dinner. The stork was <i>very happy</i> with the invitation – she reached the fox’s home on time and knocked at the door with her long beak.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fox took her to the dinner table and served some soup in <mark>shallow bowls</mark> for both of them. As the bowl was too shallow for the stork, she couldn’t have soup at all. But the fox <b><i>licked up his soup quickly</i></b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stork was <i>angry</i> and <i>upset</i>, but she didn’t show her anger and behaved politely. To teach a lesson to the fox, she then invited him for dinner the next day.
  </p>

  <p>
    She too served soup, but this time the soup was served in <b><u>two tall narrow vases</u></b>. The stork <i><b>devoured the soup</b></i> from her vase, but the fox couldn’t drink any of it because of his narrow neck.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><mark>The fox realised his mistake and went home famished.</mark></b>
  </p>

  <p><b>Moral: One bad turn deserves another.</small></p>
